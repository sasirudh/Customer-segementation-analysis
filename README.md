# Customer Behavior Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes customer data by visualizing various attributes and behavior patterns. The key features include pie charts, bar charts, and radar charts that depict different proportions, key features, and customer behavior insights.

## Overview

The project performs a comprehensive customer behavior analysis by generating various data visualizations to help interpret trends in customer behavior. The visualizations include:

- **Pie Charts**: To represent proportions of different categories within the data.
- **Bar Charts**: To show the distribution of key features and insights about customer behavior.
- **Radar Charts**: To visualize the customer behavior patterns and key metrics for different clusters.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes customer data based on attributes like `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, and other behavioral metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Generates multiple charts including pie charts, bar charts, and radar charts for effective customer analysis.
- **Clustering**: The project uses clustering algorithms to segment customers into different clusters and analyzes their behavior.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name

Set up a Python environment:

You can set up a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

Install the necessary Python libraries listed in requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Running the Visualization
After setting up the environment, you can run the Python script to generate the visualizations:
python customer_behavior_analysis.py
This script will generate the following:

Pie charts depicting the proportions of various customer attributes.
Bar charts for key features and behavior analysis.
Radar charts to represent customer behavior patterns for each cluster.
Example Output
The output includes charts like:

Pie Chart: Visualizing the distribution of Quantity and UnitPrice.
Bar Chart: Displaying the top customer segments based on behavior patterns.
Radar Chart: Showing the behavior metrics of each customer cluster.
Dependencies
This project uses the following Python libraries:

matplotlib for data visualization.
numpy for data manipulation.
pandas for handling customer data.
sklearn for clustering algorithms.
You can install all dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
